NAME
    Task::CPAN::SmokeBox - Install the things to make a CPAN Testers
    smokebox

SYNOPSIS
      perl -MCPANPLUS -e 'install Task::CPAN::SmokeBox'

DESCRIPTION
    Task::CPAN::SmokeBox is a Task that installs all the modules and
    utilities useful to set up a CPAN Testers smokebox.

    The following things will be installed:

      App::SmokeBox::Mini               # provides minismokebox
      App::SmokeBox::Mini::Plugin::IRC

      App::SmokeBrew                    # provides smokebrew

      App::Metabase::Relayd             # provides metabase-relayd

    These should be installed into the system perl on a potential smokebox
    and not the perls that will be used for CPAN testing.
